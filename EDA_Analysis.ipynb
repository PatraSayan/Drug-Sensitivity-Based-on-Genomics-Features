    "<h1>The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) </h1> The dataset combines drug response data with genomic profiles of cancer cell lines, allowing researchers to investigate the relationship between genetic features and drug sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Task </h3>\n",
    "The primary task associated with this dataset is to predict drug sensitivity (measured as IC50 values) based on genomic features of cancer cell lines. This can involve regression tasks to predict exact IC50 values or classification tasks to categorize cell lines as sensitive or resistant to specific drugs. The dataset also allows for the identification of genomic markers that correlate with drug response.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Datasets </h3>\n",
    "<h4>GDSC2-dataset.csv: </h4> Contains drug sensitivity data, including IC50 values, for various drugs tested against cancer cell lines.(Original source file)\n",
    "<h4>Cell_Lines_Details.xlsx:</h4> Provides detailed information about the cancer cell lines, including genomic features such as mutations, copy number alterations, and gene expression. (Original source file)\n",
    "<h4>Compounds-annotation.csv:</h4> Offers information about the drugs used in the screening, including their targets and pathways. (Original source file)\n",
    "<h4>GDSC_DATASET.csv:</h4> This is the main dataset file for analysis. It's a merged file combining key information from the above three files, created to facilitate easier analysis. This consolidated dataset includes all necessary features for drug sensitivity prediction and is recommended for use in your analysis.\n",
